# hubble_plot

An interactive exercise to study galaxy redshifts and produce a Hubble diagram.

The exercise is implemented with HTML, PHP, and JavaScript, and I regretted
this decision almost instantly. I wasted a lot of time getting the pieces to
play well together and so the page doesn't look too nice.  Perhaps there is a
nicer, "jupyter-y" way of doing it.

Meanwhile, to run the script, you'll need a webserver with PHP enabled.
