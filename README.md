# hubble_plot

An interactive exercise to study galaxy redshifts and produce a Hubble diagram.

The exercise is implemented with HTML, PHP, and JavaScript, and I regretted
this decision almost instantly. Perhaps there is a nicer, jupyter-y way of
doing it.

Meanwhile, to run the script, you'll need a webserver with PHP enabled.
